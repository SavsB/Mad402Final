# Case Study

## Introduction

In this case study I go over the likes and dislikes of various apps with similar functionalities to the final SPENDR app. I focus on apps that I interact with daily like TD Banking and Capital One. I also study a few dribble examples of a finanace app and a mortgae app to further my understanding of how data like this is displayed.

### TD Banking App

The green and white color scheme is a bold color choice but understandable when maintaining the company branding. The screens for paying bills,transfering money and sending money each focus on their specific goal and nothing more. (See screenshot 1). In terms of displaying data, the homepage of the app devides accounts into categories (ie. Banking,Credit,Investing) which is a design choice I like and will most likely try to incorporate in my app (see screenshot 2). 
Overall in the app there is a main focus on numbers and minimalist design and making features easy to use.


### Capital One App

The blue color scheme is again bold but lines up with the company branding. In terms of displaying data again there is a huge focus on numbers, however the design of the app makes it easy for the user to understand the data that is displayed without having to read the provided labels but the labels proivde good context to the user just getting used to the app. The hierarchy of the app is well made. The most important numbers take up the most space at the top (Balance and available credit) Followed by the secondary number (Bill due date, previous balance ect.) and finally there is a good amount of space dedicated to transactions and displaying them in a clean and useful manner. (See screenshot 3)

The color scheme is again bold, I've discussed this concept many times throughout the case study but the main takeaway is I will avoid these bold uses of color for default design and reserve it for crutical and important aspects of the app. One thing I enjoy is having an overall grand total that sums all important balances. Another choice I enjoy is the display of up and down stats like Income and Expenses (referred to as outcome in screenshot). I feel like this is a good concept that I will definately incorperate in my app. The use of images is good and helps to make the app look polished and likely welcoming to the user. However the way the app displays card information is a good use of UI heuristics of relating objects to real world items but doesn't really add to the design or usability. (See screenshot 4)

### Dribble Screenshot 2

I grabbed this screenshot to try and focus on the ways mortgage information is displayed. It clear that mortgages involve a lot of different numbers from interest rates,down payment rates etc. What I like about this screenshot is the numbers are again a main focus of the screen but they are clear and consistant and easy to understand. I like the use of the pie chart to display how the money is divided into catagories like propety taxes or insurance payments. (See Screenshot 5) The color scheme is a bit less bold. The use of UI elements like sliders and images is well thought out and makes the usability clean and understandable. (See Screenshot 5.1).

## Conclusion

During my research I often found that numbers are a very crucial part to the displays and hierarchy of these numbers is very important. Charts and graphs are often used to display information to the user especially when it comes to displaying investments and things like mortgages.
