# Case Study

## Introduction
During my research I often found that numbers are a very crucial part to the display. Charts are also heavily used to display data. Colors are often bold like in the TD,Capital One apps and the dribbble screen shot.
I don't necessarily agree with this choice, but these companies are associated with bold color schemes in their branding by default.

### TD Banking App

* The screens for paying bills,transfering money and sending money are all very minimal in design they each focus on their specific goal and nothing more.
* The homepage of the app devides accounts into categories (ie. Banking,Credit,Investing) which is a design choice I like and will most likely try to incorporate in my app. The screen places a big focus on the numbers.
